## Objective

Understand how developers save and share code.

## What I Learned

### What is Git

Git is a version control system that helps developers track changes in their code. It allows you to save different versions of your project, go back to previous versions if something breaks, and work on new features without losing your original work. It works locally on your computer.

### What is GitHub

GitHub is an online platform where developers store their Git repositories in the cloud. It helps people share their projects, collaborate with others, and keep a backup of their code online. Companies and developers use GitHub to work together on software.

### Why developers use Git and GitHub

* To track changes in their code
* To avoid losing work
* To collaborate with teammates
* To keep their projects backed up online
* To showcase their projects to recruiters and employers

## What I Did

* Installed Git on my system
* Created a folder named `WebSIG-Web-Recruitment`
* Initialized Git inside the folder
* Created a GitHub repository with the same name
* Connected my local repository to GitHub
* Pushed my code to GitHub

## Problems I Faced

* Confusion between a normal folder and a Git repository
* Remembering Git commands
* Issues while pushing code to GitHub for the first time
