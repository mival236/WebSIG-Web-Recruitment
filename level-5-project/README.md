 What the Project Does

This project is a simple To-Do List web app.  
It allows users to:
- Add tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks

What I’m Proud Of

I’m proud that I was able to:
- Build a complete project from scratch
- Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript properly
- Make the layout responsive using Flexbox
- Understand how user actions (clicks) change the page using JavaScript
- Finish the project even when things felt confusing


What I Still Don’t Fully Understand

There are still things I’m unsure about, such as:
- Why some CSS rules override others
- How positioning and Flexbox sometimes interact in complex layouts
- Writing JavaScript logic without referring to examples
