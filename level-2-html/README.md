# Level 2 — HTML Foundations

## What HTML does

HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. It helps us add headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, and other content that appears in the browser.

## Difference between div and semantic tags

A `div` is just a simple container with no meaning, while semantic tags like `header`, `main`, `section`, and `footer` clearly describe what each part of the webpage is used for. Semantic tags make the website easier to understand for developers and browsers.
